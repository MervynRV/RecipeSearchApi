o run this Flask-based Recipe Search API using the POSTMAN tool, I'll provide the full code and detailed steps for running and testing it using POSTMAN.

Steps to Run the API and Test with POSTMAN
1. Install Flask
Ensure you have Python installed, and install Flask if you haven't already:
bash


pip install flask
2. Save the Python Code
Save the provided code in a file, for example, recipe_api.py.
3. Run the Flask Application
Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where your recipe_api.py file is located and run:
bash

python recipe_api.py
Flask will start a local server. You should see something like this:
plaintext

 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * 
4. Install and Set Up POSTMAN
If you don't have POSTMAN installed, download it from here.
Once installed, open POSTMAN.

5. Make a Request in POSTMAN
Request 1: Search for Recipes

Open POSTMAN, and create a new GET request.

In the request URL field, enter:

arduino

http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/recipes?query=chicken
Click the Send button.

You should see the following response if the query matches the Chicken Salad recipe:

json

[
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Chicken Salad",
        "ingredients": [
            "chicken breast",
            "lettuce",
            "tomato",
            "cucumber",
            "olive oil"
        ],
        "instructions": "Grill chicken. Chop vegetables. Mix everything with olive oil."
    }
]
Request 2: Get a Specific Recipe by ID

Create another GET request in POSTMAN.

In the request URL field, enter:

ruby
http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/recipes/1
Click the Send button.

You should see the following response for Pasta Carbonara:

json
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Pasta Carbonara",
    "ingredients": [
        "pasta",
        "eggs",
        "parmesan cheese",
        "bacon",
        "black pepper"
    ],
    "instructions": "Boil pasta. Mix eggs and cheese. Cook bacon. Combine everything."
}
6. Modify Requests as Needed
In POSTMAN, you can modify the query parameter to search for different ingredients or recipe names.
Example: Change query=chicken to query=pasta and send the request to get recipes containing "pasta".
7. Test Edge Cases
Try searching for a recipe with an ingredient that doesnâ€™t exist, such as:

arduino
http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/recipes?query=fish
You should see a 404 response:

json

{
    "message": "No recipes found matching your query."
}
